🎨  **New theme:**<br />
Styling is updated to follow the new branding design direction (Classic theme). Support for Modern theme is also added.

🚫  **Prop deprecation:**<br />
`color` prop has been deprecated. New prop `tone` is preferred. We are using `tone` to create a consistent colour language across the design system.

🎁  **New prop:**<br />
Added new `tone` prop to the Badge, this is designed to add greater flexibility to the Badge in preparation to deprecate the `color` prop.

```jsx noeditor
<ComponentApiTable api={[
  {
    prop: 'tone',
    type:'One of string',
    default: 'undefined',
    description: 
    `Color scheme applied to the Badge (brand, neutral, success, warning, danger, info, accent)`
  },
]}/>
```
